## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

This JavaScript function prompts the user to input a student's marks and returns the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

- A: Marks greater than 79
- B: Marks between 60 and 79
- C: Marks between 50 and 59
- D: Marks between 40 and 49
- E: Marks below 40
The function validates the input to ensure it's a number between 0 and 100. If the input is invalid, it alerts the user accordingly.

# Speed Detector
This JavaScript function checks a car's speed and determines the appropriate penalty based on a speed limit.

## Features:
- Prompts the user for the car's speed in km/h.
- Validates the input (must be a positive number).
- If the speed is within the limit (70 km/h), it shows "Ok."
- If the speed exceeds the limit, it calculates demerit points (1 point for every 5 km/h over the limit).
- If demerit points exceed 12, the license is suspended. Otherwise, the points are displayed.

## Example:
> Speed = 85 km/h â†’ Output: "Points: 3" (15 km/h over the limit, 3 points)
